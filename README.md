Awesome-Puzzle-Algorithm
========================

An expertly crafted search Algorithm that quickly and efficiently finds an optimal solution to  a tedious and complex puzzle

At the moment, the main branch has the search algorithm that works alright, but you have to type in every orientation manually.
the 'create_orientaions' branch is for developing the code that generates the different orientations automatically.

Todo
____
1) write a function(s) that takes the input of one piece from user and returns an array of the six differnet orientations (as a int ****, don't you just love C)

2) write a function that checks the final solution fills the 3d space.

3) merge developement branch in to master branch.
